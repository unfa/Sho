**To play the "Stable" version of the game, download the latest release. The Master branch is not necessarily always kept fully working.**
There might be excitign stuff there, but it could jsut as well not run at all, becasue I've messed something up and didn't fix it just yet.

If you like the game and want to help make it better or turn it into something different - be my guest, though I can't guarantee I'll be able to dedicate much time to this project going forward. Also - I'm not really a software developer, so please lower your expectations as much as possible :D

I want to push this game to the state in which people could develop and share custom campaigns, and players could run for high scores and best times.
If you'd like to help develop an online leaderboard and a map repository or something like that - let me know! I'm not a web developer, so this is too far outside my area of expertise.

## Controls:

- WASD / Arrows: run
- Space: jump
- Esc: exit the game (there's no pause or menu right now)

In the 4th level (unfinished):

- R: launch the rocket
- 1-3: switch the rocket camera

## Goals and Limitations

I'm not a proffesional programmer. I'm an artist, and my main focus is sound, music and 3D art. This is a hobby project that is meant as a gift to my wife.
I know that my code is not great, that the way I've structured the project is most likely not optimal in many ways. My main gaol was to make a complete and fun game. The limited resources are stopping me from overhauling everything and making it "perfect", learning how to properly use all the Godot's tools and how to design systems properly - again: I'm doign this for fun, and it's more of a game-making playground than an engineering feat. I've created all the assets and code from scratch. I don't like using other's people art in my own work, as I find great joy in making them myself. Though - being aware of my limited resources I (for example) had to accept some poorly looking animations or player model skinning, as well as subpar enemy AI, and lack of any decent optimizations. Getting something that works was paramount, and I'm happy that was (mostly) achieved.

Maybe if there's more peopel who like this game we can together build on top of it to creat something even more fun!
