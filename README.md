A 3D platformer game created with Godot 3 game engine.

**To play the "Stable" version of the game, download the latest release. The Master branch is not necessarily always kept fully working. I'm not a developer, I'm jsut having fun.**

If you like the game and want to help make it better or turn it into something different - be my guest, though I can't guarantee I'll be able to dedicate much time to this project going forward.

I want to push it to the state in which people could develop and share custom campaigns, and others could run for high scores and best times.
If you'd like to help develop an online leaderboard and a map repository or something like that - let me know! I'm not a web developer, so this is too far outside my area of expertise.

## Controls:

- WASD / Arrows: run
- Space: jump
- Esc: exit the game (there's no pause or menu right now)

In the 4th level (unfinished):

- R: launch the rocket
- 1-3: switch the rocket camera

## Disclaimer

Hi! I'm not a proffesional programmer. I'm an artist, and my main focus is sound, music and 3D art. This is a hoby project that was meant as a gift to my wife.
I know that my code is not great, that the way I'v structured the project is most likely not optimal in many ways. My main gaol was to make a playable and fun game. The limited resources are stopping me from overhauling everything and making it "perfect", learning hwo to properly use all the programming tools and how to design systems properly - again: I'm doign this for fun, and it's more of a game-making playground than an engineering feat. I've created all the assets and code from scratch. I don't like using other's people assets in my own work, as usually - I find great joy in making them myself. Though - being aware of my limited resources I (for example) had to accept some poor animations or player model skinning, as well as subpar enemy AI, and lack of any decent optimizations. Getting something that works was paramount, and I'm happy that was (mostly) achieved.
